Application to manage Modelleisenbahn inventories.

I am planning to code an app to manage my Modelleisenbahn inventory. The app will be written in Python using Flask. Idea is to optimize it for both a plain web frontend as well as mobile. The app will allow you to manage your locomotives and waggons, enter details such as configuration, status, price, etc. I also want to be able to easily take pictures and attach them to the items. Also, you should be allowed to create search lists, so that when you are browsing ebay or visit a second hand trade fair, you can easily see what items you are looking for, what their estimated market prices are etc.
